# directx-beef
**directx-beef** is a wrapper library written in Beef for the **DirectX-API**.

This wrapper also contains some basic bindings for the **WinAPI** so you can create windows for the DirectX applications.

Disclaimer:
This wrapper is **very** not finished. At the moment it only contains most interfaces and many structures from *D3D11* and *DXGI*.

Basically everything should be considered subject to change.
