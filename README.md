# directx-beef
**directx-beef** is a wrapper library written in Beef for the **DirectX-API**.

This wrapper also contains some basic bindings for the **WinAPI** so you can create windows for the DirectX applications.

Disclaimer:
This wrapper is very unfinished. At the moment it only contains the interfaces and structures from **D3D11** and **DXGI**.

Basically everything should be considered subject to change.

# Quick Start (Beef IDE)
1. **Download** directx-beef
2. **Copy** the *DirectX*-Folder into the *BeefLibs*-Directory (usualy `C:\Program Files\BeefLang\BeefLibs`)
3. Right-click your Workspace, click **Add from Installed...** and select **DirectX**
4. Add **DirectX** as dependency for your project

There is also an example in this repository to demonstrate basic initialization and usage.
